TravelBuddy is an interactive, UGC-driven spatial mapping tool. It goes beyond traditional text-based travel notes by allowing users to create, edit, and share personalized micro-maps (e.g., Campus tours, hidden food trails) with full data ownership.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🖱️ Drag & Drop Spatial Editing**: Right-click to clone markers, drag them to new locations, and seamlessly update their data in real-time.
* **💾 Full Data Ownership (Import/Export)**: Completely local-first architecture. Export your personalized map as a lightweight JSON file and share it with friends, or import a map to instantly recreate a journey.
* **⚡ Zero-Drift Rendering Engine**: Built with a custom instance-caching mechanism to ensure 100% stable marker rendering during extreme zooming and filtering.
* **🛡️ Defensive UX Design**: Integrated safeguards against event bubbling, false clicks during map panning, and intelligent URL formatting for image inputs.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights (For Developers)
During development, several deep architectural challenges were solved:
1.  **Vue 3 Proxy vs Leaflet Collision**: Bypassed Vue's reactivity proxy on Leaflet instances using `shallowRef/markRaw` to prevent CSS transform drift during map zooms.
2.  **DOM Teleportation for Event Freedom**: Escaped Leaflet's aggressive event hijacking (which blocks `Ctrl+V` and right-click menus) by using Vue 3 `<Teleport>` to mount the Editor Modal directly to the `<body>`.
3.  **Instance Caching (Mount/Unmount)**: Replaced destructive `clearLayers()` with an intelligent diffing and caching system, ensuring markers retain their physical anchor points when toggling categories.
